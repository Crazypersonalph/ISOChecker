# ISOChecker
It is a GUI ISO checker, which is made in python with Tkinter, and can process SHA256 and GPG Checksums.

#### Are you a sysadmin who is tired of verifying their ISO's? Are you a server architect who just has to manage all those services? Don't worry!
The ISOChecker is a GUI program that allows you to simply input to values, and get a response of "Good File!", or "Bad File!".

Of course, with the actual tools themselves, they have a lot of subfeatures, that go deeper than what this program covers, but that is the point.

## This is supposed to be simple!

I made this as a little project.

The actual python file can be run on any OS, but there have only been built binaries for Windows and Linux.

I hope you find this useful

Kind Regards,
Alphons
